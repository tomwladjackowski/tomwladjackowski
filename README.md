### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tomasz Jackowski

I'm an aspiring web developer.
I'm looking to learn and work on interesting projects.
I started my adventure with programming at the University with R language, using it for statistical analysis and optimization methods.

My work for a couple of years took me in a different direction, but at the beginning of 2023 I decided to learn Web Development. I completed a bootcamp --> 
<a href="https://www.fullstack.open/" target="_blank">bootcamp.dev</a>, which quickly got me to build my first web applications. I used the <a href="https://www.bootcamp.dev/" target="_blank">Fullstack Open</a> course to further dive into modern web development.

During the bootcamp and courses, I have built a couple of small projects, which are on my GitHub page.

I am looking to get professional experience in this field, preferably somewhere, where I have the space to learn and grow as a developer.

### Languages and Tools I use:

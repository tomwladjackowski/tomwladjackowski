ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tomasz Jackowski
I'm an aspiring web developer.
I'm looking to learn and work on interesting projects.
I started my adventure with programming at the University with R language, using it for statistical analysis and optimization methods.
My work for a couple of years took me in a different direction, but at the beginning of 2023 I decided to learn Web Development. I completed a bootcamp -> bootcamp.dev, which quickly got me to build my first web applications.
I did realize, that there was quite a lot more to learn. I started the Fullstack Open course, which was more in-depth, and introduced more theoretical background.
During the bootcamp and courses, I have built a couple of small projects, which are on my GitHub page.

I am looking to get professional experience in this field, preferably somewhere, where I have the space to learn and grow as a developer.
